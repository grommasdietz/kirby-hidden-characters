# Kirby Hidden Characters

[Kirby](https://getkirby.com) plugin to visually show hidden characters in all kind of input fields and their previews. This includes white spaces and paragraph endings for now. The visual feedback is created by a custom colored font and is heavily based on the appearance of Adobeâ€™s solution in InDesign. Currently the plugin aims to work out of the box on writer fields, textareas, text fields as well as field previews, although it has only been tested in a few scenarios so far.
